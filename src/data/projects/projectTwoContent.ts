  projectIdea: `Pinky Promises came out of the idea of making relationships a little more fun and connected digitally. 
          <br></br>
          This app is basically just a little space where partners can keep track of relationship milestones, timelines, 
          share moments, play games, and even chat with an AI buddy that remembers their inside jokes. 
          <br></br>
          The goal was to create something playful, personal, and useful. 
          It's a fun companion app for couples who want to feel closer even when they're apart.`,
