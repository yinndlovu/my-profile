  aboutMeText: `Hi! I am Yin. I am currently a Computer Science final-year student. Close to
graduating though, my school just needs me to complete an internship that runs
for at least six month in order for me to be able to fulfill my graduation
requirements.
<br></br>
I am highly experienced in back-end development, super comfortable with front-end development, 
and also very familiar with DevOps practices. This combination allows me to not only build and 
design applications but also understand deployment pipelines, CI/CD, and overall 
application lifecycle management.`,

  techStackExplanation: `I have worked with all these technologies`,

  projectTwoDescription: `A mobile application built using React Native and Expo.

I have learned a lot from this project, it is by far my favorite project I have worked on so far.`,

  projectOneDescription: `This is a very cool project I recently worked on with a team from my workplace.
We created a Lecturers' Report System for my school, which is going to be used by lecturers to submit their reports
and for the school to be able to keep track of them. I was a part of the back-end team on the project, using
C# and the ASP.NET framework with the Entity Framework for the database.
