  aboutMeText: `Hi! I am Yin. I am currently a Computer Science final-year student. I am soooooo close to
graduating though, my school just needs me to complete an internship that runs
for at least six month in order for me to be able to fulfill my graduation
requirements.
<br></br>   
I am currently doing that internship. It takes up much of my time currently,
So I am not focused much on personal projects currently, although I do tend
to them from time to time. I'm just super excited to be doing this internship
as a software developer.
<br></br>            
This is my personal website (also still in the works) and below you can find the things I
know so far, my expertise and things I am currently focused on.`,

  techStackExplanation: `Some of these, I learned at school, with Java being my main focus at school
and others I self-taught. As you can already guess, Java is my strong
suit and also my favorite currently.`,

  projectOneDescription: `This is my first solo project
that I am currently working on. I have
created a Liverpool FC fan page on
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/eolupdates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Facebook </a>
which has seen some
success growing into 22,000+ followers and I am proud of the milestone.
It also has a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/enormityoflfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> group </a>
with it that carries 33,000+ members currently.
So seeing that as it is, inspired my new idea for a project and
I am going to create a mobile app for it, all about Liverpool.
<br></br>
It's an exciting project for me and due to familiarity with the
Android ecosystem, Java, Kotling and stuff,
I have decided to just start with an
Android application before anything else. After I'm successful in creation
of that then I'm going to focus on producing an iOS application for it too
which is probably going to be waaaaay later. (That's if I don't get drawn
into another project after I finish this, but we'll see).
<br></br>
The idea behind this application is to give my followers and Liverpool
fans in general an independent platform of all things Liverpool.
This app is going to have everything, and everything about Liverpool,
going all the way back to its history down to latest updates from a minute
ago. My idea is to have it all in there and to give myself more solo
experience here, and to have something I am proud of.`,

  projectTwoDescription: `This is another very cool project I am currently working on with a team from my workplace.
We are creating a Lecturers' Report System for my school, which is going to be used by lecturers to submit their reports
and for the school to be able to keep track of them. I am a part of the back-end team on the project, using
C# and the ASP.NET framework with the Entity Framework for the database.
<br></br>
Very exciting project and have learned a lot from it so far as well as from my team members, who have been incredible
from the start.`,
