  aboutMeText: `Hi! I am Yin. I am currently a Computer Science final-year student. I am soooooo close to
graduating though, my school just needs me to complete an internship that runs
for at least six month in order for me to be able to fulfill my graduation
requirements.
<br></br>   
I am currently doing that internship. It takes up much of my time currently,
So I am not focused much on personal projects currently, although I do tend
to them from time to time. I'm just super excited to be doing this internship
as a software developer.
<br></br>            
This is my personal website (also still in the works) and below you can find the things I
know so far, my expertise and things I am currently focused on.`,

  techStackExplanation: `Some of these, I learned at school, with Java being my main focus at school
and others I self-taught. My strongest suits are all the back-end languages/frameworks listed, pretty much.`,

  projectOneDescription: `A mobile application built using React Native and Expo.
<br></br>
I have learned a lot from this project, it is by far my favorite project I have worked on so far. 
I won't say much details about it, but its front end is open-source and can be found on my GitHub profile.`,

  projectTwoDescription: `This is another very cool project I am currently working on with a team from my workplace.
We are creating a Lecturers' Report System for my school, which is going to be used by lecturers to submit their reports
and for the school to be able to keep track of them. I am a part of the back-end team on the project, using
C# and the ASP.NET framework with the Entity Framework for the database.
<br></br>
Very exciting project and have learned a lot from it so far as well as from my team members, who have been incredible
from the start.
<br></br>
PS: I don't own this project,
